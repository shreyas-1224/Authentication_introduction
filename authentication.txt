task : secrets.ejs is the page we need to secure. i.e : we cant let users view or use
       this page without their verification or sign-up.

Level 1 : Authenticating with username and password.
        create a user database and then check email with password. This is lowest level 
        of security.
        This is the most unsecure way of handling the data. also, storing user's email and
        password in plain text is really dangerous.

Level 2 : Database encryption. 
        use mongoose.encryption package. it can encrypt and Authenticate. Data in database
        is encrypted now but still, we have hardcoded the secret key in our app.js. So, if
        someone hacks into app.js and aquires our key, database decryption will be supereasy.
